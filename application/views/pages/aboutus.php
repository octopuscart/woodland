                                The Quality Tourism Services (QTS) Scheme makes it easy for you to find shops, restaurants and budget visitor accommodation that you can trust.
                                Under the scheme administered by the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), QTS-accredited establishments must pass stringent annual assessments showing that they meet high standards of product quality and service. <br/>This means they must:

                                The HKTB has commissioned the Hong Kong Productivity Council as its QTS Scheme consultant responsible for conducting the assessments and mid-year surveillance visits of the shopping and dining merchants as well as visitor accommodation premises.
